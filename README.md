## 1. Project Overview <a name="ProjectOverview"></a> 
Churn Prediction is a popular problem of today business. Churn determines the clients who are going to leave the service by cancelling their subscriptions or stopping paying for the services.
By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques like Machine Learning (ML), we can be able to acticipate potential churners.

In this project, I'm going to use Apache Spark (PySpark dataframe) instead of Pandas dataframe as the analytics engine for several reasons:
1. Apache Spark is a big data engine so it can handle to case of big data set (dataset that is over the size of a single node computation).
