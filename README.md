## 1. Project Overview <a name="ProjectOverview"></a> 
The aim of this project is to build a model for classifies disaster messages. The dataset collected by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/). The [disaster response dataset](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/) contains 30,000 messages, It has been encoded with 36 different categories related to disaster response and has been stripped of messages with sensitive information in their entirety.
