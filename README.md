## 1. Project Overview <a name="ProjectOverview"></a> 
This is the capstone project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in Udacity. The goal of the project is to analyze and build a predictive model
of churn users for music application Sparkify. There are many users accessing the application everyday. They could use either free-trial or the premium
subscription plan. They can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their subscription of the service at any time. In this project, we will explore a way to predict
churn users with Apache Spark Machine Learning frameworks.


## 2. Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
The project is run in Apache Spark environment.
